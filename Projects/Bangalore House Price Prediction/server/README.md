## 2. `server/`

This directory contains the backend code that runs the Flask API to handle predictions from the model. It includes scripts to serve the trained model and process incoming data from the frontend.

### Key Files:

#### 1. `artifacts/`
This folder stores any additional artifacts generated by the server, such as logs, intermediate files, or model metadata. It helps in organizing the results from model inference or any other server-generated files.

#### 2. `server.py`
The main script that runs the Flask application. It exposes an API endpoint for users to send their input data (house features) and receive a prediction. The server interacts with the trained machine learning model to make predictions based on the userâ€™s input.

#### 3. `util.py`
Contains utility functions used by the server, such as:
- Loading the trained model from the `.pickle` file
- Data validation and preprocessing functions
- Any other helper functions used by the API to process requests and return responses.
