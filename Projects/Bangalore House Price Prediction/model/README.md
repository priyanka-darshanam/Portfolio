This folder contains everything related to model building and training. It includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest for predicting house prices.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Scripts to optimize the models and increase prediction accuracy.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved using `joblib` or `pickle` for later use by the server.

#### Key Files:

- `train_model.py`: Contains the code for training the machine learning models.
- `model.pkl`: The saved machine learning model used for predictions.
