# Bangalore House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The model incorporates various factors such as area, location, and amenities to estimate the price of a house. The project also includes the development of a web application for real-time price predictions.

## Key Steps Involved:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using **Pandas** and **Numpy**.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features such as area, location, and amenities to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: 
  - **Linear Regression**: Used for baseline predictions.
  - **Decision Trees**: Applied to capture non-linear relationships.
  - **Random Forest**: Ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Achieved **84% accuracy** on test data using performance metrics like **R2 Score** and **RMSE**.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy.
- **Web Development**: Flask for back-end development.
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the web interface.
- **API Testing**: Postman for validating real-time predictions.

## Web Application
A **Flask**-based web application was developed to provide real-time house price predictions. The front-end interface, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, allows users to input house details and receive price predictions instantly.
