# About Me

Hello! I'm **Priyanka**, a passionate aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong background in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I recently completed my engineering degree in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** and I'm focused on learning and building projects in the field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

Although I am relatively new to the industry, I am actively working on improving my skills, experimenting with new algorithms, and contributing to projects that allow me to learn and grow. I am excited about **reinforcement learning**, **AI ethics**, and how machine learning models can solve real-world problems.
